    My name is Adrian Romero. I was born in Queens, New York in July 1992. I lived in New York until I was
    10 years old. My parents moved me to Bethlehem, PA because we had family there and wanted to get out of New York.
    Once we arrived I got settled in and ended up graduating from Liberty High School in Bethlehem, PA few years later.
    I've worked with banks and credit unions for about 5 years, but I believe now I found my true calling. My misson now
    is to become a successful web developer and provide for my family. 
</p>
<p>I am currently attending UPENN LPS coding bootcamp program. I am excited for graduation and to get started looking for jobs. </p>
